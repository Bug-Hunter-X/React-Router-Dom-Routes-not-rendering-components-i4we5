This repository contains a bug report and solution for a React Router Dom issue where routes fail to render components upon navigation.  The URL in the browser updates correctly, but the UI remains unchanged. The bug.js file demonstrates the problematic code, while bugSolution.js provides a corrected version. The root cause and solution are detailed in the comments within the code files.
